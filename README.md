# Chicago Crime Visualization

*Rebecca Oh*

This R Shiny app allows interactive visualization of Chicago crime between 2001 and 2019. Data was pulled using Google BigQuery to connect to the Chicago Crime Database, which is available here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/data

In this app, users are able to select a specific Chicago district and range of years of interest. At least one primary type of crime can also be chosen.

The following link will direct you to the app:
